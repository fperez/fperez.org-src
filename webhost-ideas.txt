Well this is what I do.

First off I have Dreamhost which allows unlimited domains, space &
bandwidth. It's not 6-nines, but it works for me. Full SSH, SFTP, etc access.

1) My 'domain' is blank. It points to nothing.

2) Every picture I've ever taken is at pictures.X.org. Password Protected.
If I want to show someone something I'll open a folder for them using
htaccess. It's also my off-site backup for my pictures.

2) SVN. Dreamhost lets you easily setup SVN. I honestly just discovered
version control in the last month (More or less took the time to learn it)
and absolutely love it. So all my pet projects have an svn.X.org page.

3) Sub domains for where I post the most. Since I post quite a few
photoshops/images to Fark. I have a fark.X.org that is nothing but pictures.
I have a vw.X.org for posting pictures of my Dubs to VWVortex and TDICLub. I
try not to move the directory around at all. I hate digging up a 6 month old
"how to" and find all the images are broken.

4) Unlimited e-mail. I have catch-all turned on. slashdot@X.org, fark@x.org,
facebook@X.org, I know exactly when and where spam comes from. (Damn you USA
Rugby*).

5) Subdomains to my computers. Both my linux desktop and mac laptop have
scripts to update mac/linux.X.org with the current IP.

6) gallery.X.org for people in my family to upload stuff. (With Gallery2).

7) A few friends have websites at name.X.org. I create a new FTP or SFTP
user for them

8) If you have SSH access, I route everything through at work. Dynamic proxy
and I don't go through the work proxy servers.

Half of those blur the line between domain/host but you get the idea.
