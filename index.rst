 Welcome
=========

I am a research scientist at the `Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute
<http://neuroscience.berkeley.edu/>`_ at U.C. Berkeley.  My work involves the
development and implementation of new algorithms and tools for neuroimaging,
with a special interest in functional MRI.  I am also actively involved with
the development of new tools for high-level scientific computing, mostly using
the `Python <http://python.org>`_ language.

* `Research <research>`_.

* Some `<talks>`_.

* `Scientific computing in Python <py4science>`_, `IPython
  <http://ipython.scipy.org>`_ and related matters.

* Other `software tools <code>`_.

* A `blog <http://fdoperez.blogspot.com>`_, where I post items of interest
  related to IPython, SciPy and scientific computing in Python.
