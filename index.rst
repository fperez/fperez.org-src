 Welcome
=========

I am a research scientist at the `Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute`__ at
U.C. Berkeley.  My work involves the development and implementation of new
algorithms and tools for neuroimaging, with a special interest in functional
MRI.  I am also actively involved with the development of new tools for
high-level scientific computing, mostly using the Python_ language.  In this
site, you can find more `<research>`_ details, including publications, as well
as a subset of `<talks>`_ presented at various venues.

I am convinced that we need better tools for scientific computing and that the
efforts of many to build them based on the Python_ language are starting to pay
off in a way that will have significant benefits in the long run.  I try to do
my part on that front by working on IPython_, the development of neuroimaging
tools such as nipy_ (and especially its nitime_ component), and my
contributions to various projects affiliated with the `scipy stack`_.  The
`Py4Science <py4science>`_ page contains details and material on this topic.

On campus, I coordinate an informal `meeting series`_ every 2 weeks that is
open to all, where we cover topics related to the use and development of Python
for scientific research.  If you are interested in using Python in your
research, would like to learn more about it or have developed something you'd
like feedback on, please stop by!

If you are coming to visit, this map_ may be useful (we share space with
Berkeley's CIRL, hence the name in the map).  Our door is the first on the left
once you enter the East facing building doors at ground level.
