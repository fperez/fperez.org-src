 Welcome
=========

I am a research scientist at the `Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute`__ at
U.C. Berkeley.  My work involves the development and implementation of new
algorithms and tools for neuroimaging, with a special interest in functional
MRI.  I am also actively involved with the development of new tools for
high-level scientific computing, mostly using the Python_ language.

* Other `software tools <code>`_.

* A blog_, where I post items of interest related to IPython, SciPy and
  scientific computing in Python.

If you are coming to visit, this map_ may be useful (we share space with
Berkeley's CIRL, hence the name in the map).  Our door is the first on the left
once you enter the East facing building doors at ground level.
