=========
 Welcome
=========

I am an associate professor in the `Department of Statistics
<http://statistics.berkeley.edu>`_ at UC Berkeley, and a Faculty  Scientist at
the `Data Science and Technology Division`__ of Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory, as well as a researcher at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science
(BIDS_, an Institute where I am a founding co-investigator).  My research
interests, shaped over years of working on a number of applied problems in
physics, mathematics and neuroscience, revolve around the question of building
tools for computational research across all scientific domains.

I am convinced that we need better tools for scientific computing, and that our
efforts to build them based on the Python_ language can make a significant
difference to how scientific research is conducted and disseminated.  I created
the IPython_ project while a graduate student in 2001, which has now evolved
into the large and collaborative `Project Jupyter`_, where a talented team does
all the hard work.  I am an active member of the community that creates freely
available scientific computing tools around the `SciPy stack`_, I regularly
lecture about scientific computing in Python and I am a founding board member of
the NumFOCUS_ foundation.  The `Py4Science <py4science>`_ page contains more
details on this.
