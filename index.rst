 Welcome
=========

I am a staff scientist at the `Data Science and Technology Division`__ of
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, as well as a researcher at the Berkeley
Institute for Data Science (BIDS_, an Institute where I am a founding
co-investigator).  My research interests, shaped over years of working on a
number of applied problems in physics, mathematics and neuroscience, revolve
around the question of building tools for computational research across all
scientific domains.

I am convinced that we need better tools for scientific computing, and that our
efforts to build them based on the Python_ language can make a significant
difference to how scientific research is conducted and disseminated.  I created
the IPython_ project while a graduate student in 2001 and continue to lead the
project, now as a collaborative effort with a talented team_ that does all the
hard work.  I am an active member of the community that creates freely
available scientific computing tools around the `SciPy stack`_, I regularly
lecture about scientific computing in Python and I am a founding board member
of the NumFOCUS_ foundation.  The `Py4Science <py4science>`_ page contains more
details on this.


You can contact me via email or Twitter_.
