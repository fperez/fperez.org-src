I'm a scientist and a geek, and thus I spend much of my time in front of either
the computer or a book.  If not there, you may find me climbing (hopefully
outdoors!) and probably with a camera.  Mostly of interest to friends and
family, I keep my pictures online at a `picasa album`_.

I also have a blog_, where I mostly post items of interest related to IPython,
SciPy and scientific computing in Python.  I haven't been able to really get
caught up in the whole blogging thing, so it's rather sparse, but people tell
me it's useful, so I may try to post more, we'll see...
