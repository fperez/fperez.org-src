=============================
 CSE'09 article in SIAM News
=============================


This isn't fresh-off-the-oven news, but it's still on the main SIAM News page,
so I'll mention it as I am trying to do a better job of keeping up with this
blog...

As I mentioned on a `previous post`_, our three_ part_ minisymposium_ on Python
at the SIAM `CSE09 conference`_ was fairly well received.  But even better,
SIAM asked us to write up an article for publication in the `SIAM News
bulletin`_.  I was really pleased with this, as SIAM News reaches a very broad
international audience and is actually read by people.  I often find very
interesting material in it, as the publication hits a very good balance of
quality and not being overly specialized (as we all drown in work, we tend to
focus only on very narrow publication lists for everyday reading,
unfortunately).

Randy, Hans-Petter and I drafted up an article, and we received great feedback
from all of the presenters at the minisymposium, including figure contributions
by `John Hunter`_ and `Hank Childs`_ (who was at LLNL at the time, and I'm
delighted to see is just up the hill from me at LBL).

Our article is now available in HTML `online at the SIAM site`_, and I also
have a `PDF version`_ that is more suitable for printing in case you are
interested (note that my version is missing the very last corrections from the
SIAM editor, but the differences should be minor).
