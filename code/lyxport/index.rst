**Export a Lyx or LaTeX file to HTML, PostScript and PDF**

.. note::

   lyxport is old, unmaintained and probably useless code.  Today's LyX export
   abilities are far superior, so I really doubt you need this.  But lyxport
   was my first open source tool that saw significant usage, so I have a soft
   spot for it.

   Even though the original code was licensed under the GPL, if for some reason
   you happen to be interested in this, drop me a line and I'll change the
   license to BSD.

lyxport is a Perl script which takes a LyX_ or TeX file as its only argument
(with or without extension) and produces HTML, PostScript and PDF versions of
the document. The name is short for "lyx export".
