# fperez.org - Sphinx sources

This repo is an archive of the raw Sphinx source files for my former website that used to live at fperez.org. I lost that site in 2022 due to a failure by my domain provider to notify me of its expiration, against ICANN regulations (name.com, I don't recommend them!).  I am publishing the my last build of these sources via  Github Pages at [fperez.github.io/fperez.org/](https://fperez.github.io/fperez.org) in order to have a public archive of the original site.

The static HTML build published there [can be found at this repo](https://github.com/fperez/fperez.org); it was produced on Dec. 27, 2017 (using Sphinx 1.6.3).

My official website now lives at https://fernandoperez.org.
