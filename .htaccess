# By default, Dreamhost will treat .py files as cgi scripts, whereas I'm not
# running any python CGI code here.  It's therefore OK to set .py to be plain
# text everywhere, by making this the site top-level .htaccess file.
#
# If I ever start using .py cgi scripts, I can always make a directory-specific
# .htaccess file that makes the .py handler be the cgi one.

AddHandler default-handler .py
AddType text/plain .py
