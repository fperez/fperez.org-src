  I'm very excited to visit Colombia for a month, to teach an intensive course
  on scientific computing using Python and a practical, modern and hopefully
  useful approach.  I've created a section on `Teaching <teaching>`_ with these
  materials, including a detailed page on the :ref:`planned course
  <scicomp_course>`.
