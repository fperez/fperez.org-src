 Python for Scientific Computing at SIAM CSE 2011: Slides
==========================================================

At the `2011 SIAM CSE meeting`_ held in Reno on February 28-March 6, Randy
LeVeque from U. Washington, Hans-Petter Langtangen from the Simula Research
Laboratory in Norway and I co-organized a 2-part minisymposium entitled *Python
for Scientific Computing*.  This was done partly as a followup to the
successful one we had `in 2009`_, and we had again good attendance and lively
discussions.

Our minisymposium was divided in two parts, and I am posting here links to the
original program pages as well as all the slides I have so far from the
speakers, along with any links they may have provided to their personal or
project pages.  A `short narrative is my blog 
<http://blog.fperez.org/2011/04/python-goes-to-reno-siam-cse-2011.html>`_ and I
also put
`some pictures <https://picasaweb.google.com/fdo.perez/SIAMCSE2011InReno#>`_ up.

As a sign of the healthy growth of the scientific python ecosystem, this year
there were also other python-focused minisymposia at this conference, as well
as several python talks in other MS; those slides are below_.
