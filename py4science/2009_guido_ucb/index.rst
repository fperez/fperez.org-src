On November 4 2009, we had a special session of our informal Py4Science_
seminar series, where Guido van Rossum visited for an open discussion regarding
the uses of the Python language in scientific research.  On my blog I have
already `posted a longer narrative`_ on this topic, the main purpose of this
page is to hold links to the slides from all the presentations.

Keep in mind that these were *extremely short*, less than 4 minutes long in
general (we covered 14 presentations in 50 minutes flat), so you may want to
have a look at them in conjunction with the video_ of the session [1]_.  The
rapid-fire sequence of 'lightning talks' covers the first part, and the open
discussion with Guido starts at the 54 minute mark and lasts for one hour.

I presented both an overview of Python in scientific work, and also material
from 4 other projects whose authors could not attend in person.  I am very
thankful to them for sending me their slides, and in advance I apologize for
somewhat butchering their material, as I crammed both the general discussion
and 4 sub-talks in a total of about 16 minutes.

The full list of presenters/slides for the lightning talks are:

Once we opened for general discussion, we took a quick hand vote based on
`these topics <fperez_discussion.pdf>`_ I'd listed as possible starting points,
and we had about one hour of conversation with Guido.  You should be able to
get the gist of it from the video; fortunately even though the questions from
the audience can't be heard very well, they are short and Guido's replies
contain sufficient information to understand the context.

I am very happy with the overall result of this meeting, and I hope it's only
the start of a longer dialogue between the scientific community and the core
developers of the language.

.. [1] Thanks to Jeff Teeters from the Redwood Institute, we have once again an
   excellent record of the session (Jeff has kindly taped all recent Py4Science
   meetings, and did a spectacular job with Kilian Koepsell taping the whole
   SciPy'09 conference).
