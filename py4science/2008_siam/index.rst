 Python and Sage at SIAM'08
============================

At the `2008 SIAM meeting`_ in San Diego, Randy LeVeque from U. Washington and
I co-organized 3-part minisymposium entitled *Python and Sage: Open Source
Scientific Computing*. At `my blog`_ you can find more details, this page only
contains links to all the presentations I was able to get from the speakers.

* Fernando Perez - `Python: A Scalable Tool for Scientific and Mathematical
  Computing <0807_siam_intro_python_scicomp.pdf>`_.

  in Python <numpy_scipy.ppt>`_.

* Robert Bradshaw - `Sage: A Unified Environment for Mathematical Computation
  <SIAM___Sage.sws.pdf>`_ (this is just a PDF, the original Sage files can be
  found `here
