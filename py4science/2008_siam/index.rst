 Python and Sage at SIAM'08
============================

At the `2008 SIAM meeting`_ in San Diego, Randy LeVeque from U. Washington and
I co-organized 3-part minisymposium entitled *Python and Sage: Open Source
Scientific Computing*. At `my blog`_ you can find more details, this page only
contains links to all the presentations I was able to get from the speakers.
