 Installation instructions for Geilo Winter School
===================================================

This page contains the instructions on the tools you need to set up in advance
for my lectures at the 2013 `Geilo Winter School on Reproducible Science And
Modern Scientific Software
<http://www.sintef.no/Projectweb/eVITA/Winter-Schools/2013>`_.  Please `contact
me <Fernando.Perez@berkeley.edu>`_ if you run into any problems and I'll do my
best to assist you.


Accounts and software install
=============================

Start by signing up for a (free) account on `Github <http://github.com>`_.

**Mac or Windows users**

- Download and install `git <http://git-scm.com/downloads>`_.  You can accept
  all the default options from the installer.

- Download and install the free edition of the `Enthought Python Distribution
  (EPD) <https://www.enthought.com/products/epd_free.php>`_. 

You will also need to update the IPython notebook installation to the current
version:

* On a Mac, using the Terminal application::

    sudo enpkg enstaller
    sudo enpkg ipython

* On Windows, at the Command Prompt (``cmd.exe`` application)::

    enpkg enstaller
    enpkg ipython

**Linux users**

You can also use EPD, but most up to date distributions have everything we need
in their package managers.  On Ubuntu or other Debian-based distributions, type
at the shell::

    sudo apt-get install ipython-notebook python-scipy python-matplotlib python-nose \
                         git gitk git-gui

On Fedora or other non-apt distributions, please refer to your package manager
(the package names should be very similar).


Editing code
============

If you have a favorite programming editor already, skip this section.

Python is a programming language, so at some point you'll need to type code.
Learning how to use a good, powerful text editor is one of the best investments
of time you can make in terms of computing-related skills.  I'm a life emacs
user, but vi is equally sophisticated (in a very different style).  These
editors, however, aren't the easiest to get started with (if you're serious
about computing though, I strongly recommend you do learn how to use them).

If you want something with a slightly easier learning curve to begin with, the
following are all free, good options:

* Linux: gedit (typically installed by default).
* OSX: `Text Wrangler <http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler>`_.
* Windows: `Notepad ++ <http://notepad-plus-plus.org>`_.


Test that everything is ready
=============================

Once you've installed the code above, please download (save to your disk) `this
file <workshop_checklist.py>`_ and execute it as per the instructions contained
in it (at the top).  It runs a set of sanity checks on your system to ensure
that things are reasonably well installed, and will provide diagnostics
information along with instructions on what to do.
