 Python for Scientific Computing at SIAM: Slides
==================================================

At the `2009 SIAM CSE meeting`_ held in Miami on March 2-6, Randy LeVeque from
U. Washington, Hans-Petter Langtangen from the Simula Research Laboratory in
Norway and I co-organized a 3-part minisymposium entitled *Python for
Scientific Computing*.  This was done partly as a followup to the successful
one we had `last year`_, and we had again good attendance and lively discussions.
See a short `blog post`_ of mine for some more thoughts on the event, this page
is just for hosting the slides.

.. note:: 

   SIAM News published a full writeup of this event.  Here are both a PDF
   suitable for printing and the version SIAM put on their site:

     at CSE09 <../../papers/py4science09_siam_news.pdf>`_, SIAM News, 42:5, 4
     (2009). `Bibtex entry`_.

   * An `html version`_ from the SIAM site: it contains one less figure and
     minor text differences arising from the final round of edits by SIAM.

The minisymposium was divided in three parts, and I am posting here links to
the original program pages as well as all the slides I have so far from the
speakers, along with any links they may have provided to their personal or
project pages.
