=================================
 Python for scientific computing
=================================

The Python language is an excellent tool for scientific computing and rapidly
growing in popularity.  This page gathers some information and resources on
this topic.

- A blog_, where I post items of interest related to IPython, SciPy and
  scientific computing in Python.

- Some `notes about decorators for controlling execution <decorators.html>`_
  from a September 2009 talk at the Berkeley Py4Science group.

- A "`Python for scientific computing Starter Kit <starter_kit.html>`_".  I
  often encounter scientists who need resources on where to get quickly started
  with Python.  This is a small document I've written to try to gather pointers
  to useful resources, reading materials and downloads for such a person.

- In October 2008 I'm holding a `2-day workshop <workshop_berkeley_2008.html>`_
  introducing Python for scientists.  The workshop is now over, but most of the
  lectures were videotaped and can be found `here`__.

- I have posted `the slides I have <2008_siam>`_ from the Python/Sage
  minisymposium at the 2008 SIAM annual meeting.

- Feedback `from the numpy community <numpy-pep225/README.html>`_ on Python's PEP
  225 regarding the implementation of new arithmetic operators.

- I have recently received a copy of the book `Expert Python Programming
  <http://www.packtpub.com/expert-python-programming/book>`_ by Tarek Ziad√© for
  review.  You can read my full `review here`_.

- In March 2009, I co-organized another Python mini-symposium at a SIAM
  meeting, this time the Computational Science and Engineering one.  I've
  `posted`_ a summary report on my blog, and `this page <2009_siam_cse>`__ has
  all the slides I have so far.

- In April 2009, we will be having a `PyMVPA/NiPy meeting
  <pymvpa_nipy_sprint_200904.html>`_, where we will work on integration issues
  as well as having two lectures by the PyMVPA team.
