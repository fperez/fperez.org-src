 Python for scientific computing
=================================

The Python language is an excellent tool for scientific computing and rapidly
growing in popularity.  This page gathers some information and resources on
this topic.

Resources
=========

`Py4Science meeting series`_ at UC Berkeley
  An open, informal series open to anyone interested in using, learning about
  or contributing to Python-based tools for scientific research.

`Why Python? <why_python.html>`_
  A short page you may find useful if you are wondering why you should consider
  the Python language as a research tool.
  
A `Python for scientific computing Starter Kit <starter_kit.html>`_
  If either I or someone else convinced you with a "why python?" discussion,
  and you are asking "OK, now what?", this may be useful.

`Python warts <warts.html>`_ for scientific work
  No tool is perfect, this is the summary of my annoyances.
  
A blog_
  I (occasionally) post items related to this topic.

In reverse chronological order, links to meetings, discussions or other items
of interest on this topic.

September 2009, decorators
  Some `notes about decorators for controlling execution <decorators.html>`_
  from a September 2009 talk at the Berkeley Py4Science group.

April 2009, PyMVPA
  We will be having a `PyMVPA/NiPy meeting <pymvpa_nipy_sprint_200904.html>`_,
  where we will work on integration issues as well as having two lectures by
  the PyMVPA team.

March 2009, *Expert Python Programming* book review
  I have recently received a copy of the book `Expert Python Programming
  <http://www.packtpub.com/expert-python-programming/book>`_ by Tarek Ziad√©,
  you can read my full `review here`_.

March 2009, SIAM CSE09
  I co-organized another Python mini-symposium at a SIAM meeting, this time the
  Computational Science and Engineering one.  I've `posted`_ a summary report
  on my blog, and `this page <2009_siam_cse>`__ has all the slides I have so
  far.

October 2008, 2-day hands-on workshop at UC Berkeley
  I'm holding a `2-day workshop <workshop_berkeley_2008.html>`_ introducing
  Python for scientists.  The workshop is now over, but most of the lectures
  were videotaped and can be found `here`__.

September 2008, PEP 225 for extended binary operators in Python
  Feedback `from the numpy community <numpy-pep225/README.html>`_ on Python's PEP
  225 regarding the implementation of new arithmetic operators.

June 2008, Python and Sage at the annual SIAM meeting
  I have posted `the slides I have <2008_siam>`_ from the Python/Sage
  minisymposium at the 2008 SIAM annual meeting.
