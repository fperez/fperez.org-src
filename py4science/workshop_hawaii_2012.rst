Accounts and software install
=============================

Start by signing up for a (free) account on `Github <http://github.com>`_.

**Mac or Windows users**

- Download and install `git <http://git-scm.com/downloads>`_.  You can accept
  all the default options from the installer.

- Download and install the free edition of the `Enthought Python Distribution
  (EPD) <https://www.enthought.com/products/epd_free.php>`_. 

You will also need to update the IPython notebook installation to the current
version:

* On a Mac, using the Terminal application::

    sudo enpkg enstaller
    sudo enpkg ipython

* On Windows, at the Command Prompt (``cmd.exe`` application)::

    enpkg enstaller
    enpkg ipython

**Linux users**

You can also use EPD, but most up to date distributions have everything we need
in their package managers.  On Ubuntu or other Debian-based distributions, type
at the shell::

    sudo apt-get install git ipython python-scipy python-matplotlib python-nose

On Fedora or other non-apt distributions, please refer to your package manager
(the package names should be very similar).


Test that everything is ready
=============================

Once you've installed the code above, please download (save to your disk) `this
file <workshop_checklist.py>`_ and execute it as per the instructions contained
in it (at the top).  It runs a set of sanity checks on your system to ensure
that things are reasonably well installed, and will provide diagnostics
information along with instructions on what to do.
